Contained here are my solutions to each one of [Shenzhen I/O's](https://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/ "Official Site") tasks.
I took the liberty of adding screenshots of each design to accompany the solution code as to prevent confusion regarding component usage. It is within the player's best interest to achieve an end result that utilizes the smallest amount of resources possible.
